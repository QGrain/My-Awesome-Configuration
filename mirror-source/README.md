# Change-MirrorSource
Cross-platform scripts for Changing Mirror Source :wrench:

## Background
Mirror source is a technique for conveient downloading. However, sometimes it is embarrassed to find that the official mirror source is too slow to download normally. We have to change the mirror to a closer one with a couple of commands, which vary on different system. 

**Therefore, here comes a tool to manage all the mirrors that are suitable for your platform and location.**

## Usage
```bash
# clone this repo
cd My-Awesome-Configuration/mirror-source
./change-mirror-source.sh

```

## Todo
- [x] Update README
